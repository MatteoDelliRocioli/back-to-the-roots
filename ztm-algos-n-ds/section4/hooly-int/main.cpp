/* Take notes
 * what are the inputs and the outputs?
 * do I have time and space constraints?
 * start with the naive brute approach, speack outloud to make your
 		tought process clear
 * observe and tell why the brute approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2)
 		algorithm or higher, not readable etc...)
 * check your code for possible bugs (think about edge cases)
 * did you use all the information provided?
 * focus on the bottleneck (code with the greatest big O)
 *
 * while you code write down the steps you are going to follow
 * modularize your code right from the beginning
 * never start writing code unless you are sure how the things are going
 		to work
 * start with the easy part
 * tell that you would now write test to see if the code works properly
 * use meaningful variable names
 * go through your code outloud to test it live
 * propose different solutions, talk about what you would google, other
		interesting solutions that you didn't think about?
 * how would you change the solution if you would have to deal with
 		large inputs (too large to stay in memory)? // divide and conquer
 		approach
 * Communicate your thought process as much as possible
 * */

 /* The goal is to find a pair present in the array where the sum of
 * those is equal to a provided amount
 *
 * data sets:
 *
 * [1, 2, 3, 9] Sum = 8 -> no
 * [1, 2, 4, 4] Sum = 8 -> yes
